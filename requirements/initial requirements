The exercise consists of writing out a strategic QA approach for an ecommerce website. There
are two main features below with some stories/requirements. Your job is to identify any
questions you may have for the Product Owner about the requirements, and to write out test
cases for verifying the functionality as written, then describe your approach to executing the
actual testing.

Feel free to write about any additional concerns you might bring up to the product team about
testing the website and/or any defects you observe. (Note – This is a live website used by a
company, so defects are not guaranteed)
